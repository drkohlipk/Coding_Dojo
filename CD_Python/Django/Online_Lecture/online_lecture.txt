Please remove these lectures from the lessons on here.  They aren't helpful and you can't see everything that is going on so it is just confusing.  There is also a lot of whitespace in these videos so they aren't very engaging either.  Not trying to be a downer, just trying to help in making this course more amazing than it already is!
